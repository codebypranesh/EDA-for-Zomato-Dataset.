# Zomato EDA Analysis

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Zomato dataset using Python. The goal is to extract insights, understand trends, and visualize the variations in restaurant data across different countries.

## 📊 Project Overview

The analysis dives into various aspects of the Zomato dataset such as:

- Country-wise distribution of restaurants
- Variations in rating scales and customer preferences
- Analysis of popular cuisines
- Cost comparisons and affordability across locations
- Observations from highest to lowest rated restaurants
- Filtering out irrelevant or duplicate data to focus on meaningful insights

The EDA was performed using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: [Zomato Restaurants Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/)

> Note: Ensure the dataset is placed in the working directory or update the path in the notebook accordingly.

## 📌 Key Observations

- India has the highest number of listed restaurants.
- Ratings vary significantly by country and cuisine.
- Some cuisines are more associated with high ratings.
- Many restaurants are clustered within specific rating brackets.
- Identified outliers and missing/incomplete data points for cleanup.

## ▶️ Running the Notebook

To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   📷 Sample Visuals
The notebook contains plots such as:

Bar charts for top cuisines

Pie charts for country distributions

Histograms for rating spreads

Count plots for rating categories

✅ Conclusion
This project provides insights into how food preferences, ratings, and affordability differ across countries. It lays the foundation for further work like recommendation systems or predictive models based on restaurant data.
